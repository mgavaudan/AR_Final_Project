**AR WARS**

Project directory overview: scripts under "Scripts"; space texture under "Textures"; minimap under "Scenes"; enemy, missile, orb, & door under "Prefabs"; light saber under "Models"; enemy particle pack under "Materials"; image targets under "Editor"

Instructions for deploying: Disable orientation lock. Cardboard works best with Android; may need to reconfigure parameters (specifically Inter Lens Distance & Distortion Coefficients).

App usage: Use "stones" image as wall target at eye level (orb attaches to this). Use cylindrical target for Light Saber. Use "acid" target for The Force. Use Cardboard with front panel cut out so that phone camera is exposed. Position yourself 2-3 feet away from the wall target. Use Light Saber to deflect red laser balls into enemy squares. Use The Force (appears as a ray) to destroy enemies and select the door to move into the next room when enemies are cleared. Tilting the hand with The Force allows you to rotate around the current room.
